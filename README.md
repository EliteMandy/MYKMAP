# KMapGenerator
JavaScript web application that I coded for my year project during the 2016-2017 year. It allows students to train themselves in logic circuit synthesis, specifically in the solving of Karnaugh Maps, and facilitates the creation of new exercise sheets by teachers. The application allows the user to generate their own exercises by building a custom Karnaugh Map of up to 5 logic variables (with an option for “don’t care” symbols), and dynamically displays the exercise’s solution in real-time, by means of an interactive logic function, and an exportable string of LaTeX (askmaps) code.
